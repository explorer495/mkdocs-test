# Operation

At startup the clock will calculate a start time based on either a) a coded start time (currently 6:00 a.m.) or b) a run time stored in the EEPROM (see item 2) below.

The clock will start in a paused state and will display the speed rate factor (default = x 4).  Once any adjustemts have been made the clock can be started.  The usage of the six buttons are as below:

1. **Start** - Pressing this button will start the clock and the button text will change to **Pause**.  
2. **Save** - Pressing this button will pause the clock and save the current time and Speed Factor to the EEPROM.  These figures will be used to initialise the clock on nextstartup.
3. **Reset** - Pressing this button will pause the clock and set the time to 06:00 with a speed factor of 4.
4. **T+** - Pressing this key will pause the clock and add 15 minutes to the time.
5. **T-** - Pressing this key will pause the clock and deduct 15 minutes from the time.
6. **Rate** - Pressing this key will increase the speed factor to the next level.  The speed factor will cycle around the seven speed settings of 1, 2, 4, 6,, 8, 12 & 30.

In Serial Mode, at startup the initial clock time will be sent to the Command Station but when in a paused state no further time commands are sent until the START button is pressed.

In I2C mode the Command Station polls the FastClock at intervals.
