# Hardware device list

The following hardware devices, available from various sources, have support code built in to the Command Station. Some are commonly used in the electronics and Arduino market, others are specifically designed for model railway use.

Although the devices are summarised here, you should refer to EXRAIL cookbooks for examples of how to use these, or refer to the appropriate source code, normally found in a file called IO_something.h (e.g. IO_PCA9685.h)
