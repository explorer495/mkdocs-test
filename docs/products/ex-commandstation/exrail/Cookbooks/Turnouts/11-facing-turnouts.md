# Facing turnouts

When you have turnouts that face each other, its awkward for the throttle user to have to manually switch both to match each other. By treating the crossover as a single turnout, control is simplified and incorrect combinations are prevented.

To do this, we need to hide one of the turnouts from the user, and make sure that throwing/closing the visible turnout automatically throws/closes the other turnout.

All turnout definitions in EXRAIL allow for a text description to be shown to the user throttle. The HIDDEN keyword, used instead of a turnout description prevents it being visible to the throttle or JMRI/iTrain etc.

```cpp
TURNOUTL(1,101,"Cross inner to outer")
TURNOUTL(2,102,HIDDEN)

ONTHROW(1) THROW(2) DONE
ONCLOSE(1) CLOSE(2) DONE
```
