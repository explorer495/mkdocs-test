# NeoPixel support

The IO_NeoPixel.h driver supports the adafruit neopixel seesaw board. It turns each pixel into an individual VPIN which can be given a colour and turned on or off using the the NEOPIXEL EXRAIL macro. EXRAIL SIGNALS can also drive a single pixel signal or multiple separate pixels.

## Defining the hardware driver

Add a driver definition in myAutomation.h for each adafruit I2C driver.

```cpp
    HAL(neoPixel, firstVpin, numberOfPixels [, mode [, i2caddress])
```

Where mode is selected from the various pixel string types which have varying colour order or refresh frequency. For MOST strings this mode will be NEO_GRB but for others refer to the comments in IO_NeoPixel.h

If omitted the node and i2caddress default to NEO_GRB, 0x60.

For example:

```cpp
    HAL(NeoPixel,1000,20)
```

This is a NeoPixel driver defaulting to I2C aqddress 0x60 for a GRB pixel string. Pixels are given vpin numbers from 1000 to 1019.

```cpp
    HAL(NeoPixel,1020,20,NEO_GRB,0x61)
```

This is a NeoPixel driver on i2c address 0x61.
