# Lew's Duino Gear boards

CAUTION: these boards require several GPIO pins on the Command Station and are therefore unsuitable for use with a CSB1 which has all available pins essentially reserved for track management.

## DNIN8 8 Input board

This is a shift-register implementation of a digital input collector.
Multiple DNIN8 may be connected in a chain sequence but it is IMPORTANT that the software configuratuion correctly represents the number of boards connected otherwise the results will be meaningless.

Define boards in EXRAIL using HAL(IO_DNIN8, firstVpin, numPins, clockPin, latchPin, dataPin)

```cpp
   HAL(IO_DNIN8, 400, 16, 40, 42, 44)
```

This will create VPINs 400-415 using two DNIN8 boards connected in sequence.
VPINS 400-407 will be on the first board (closest to the CS) and 408-415 on the second.

Note: 16 pins uses two boards. You may specify a non-multiple-of-8 pins but this will be rounded up to a multiple of 8 and you must connect ONLY the number of boards that this takes.

This example used Arduino GPIO pins 40,42,44 as these are conveniently side-by-side on a Mega which is easier when you are using a 3 strand cable.

## DNIN8K 8 Input board

This module works the same as DNIN8 but you must use DNIN8K in the HAL setup instead of DNIN8. You can't mix 8 and 8k versions in the same string of boards but you can create another string of boards.

## DNOU8 8 Output board

DNOU8 works in a very similar fashion to the the DNIN boards and is defined in EXRAIL using
 HAL(IO_DNOU8, firstVpin, numPins, clockPin, latchPin, dataPin)

```cpp
HAL(IO_DNOU8, 450, 16, 45, 47, 49)
```

This creates a string of output VPINs 450-465 (and thus on 2 boards). Note the clock/latch/data pins must be different to any DNIN8 or DNIN8K pins.
