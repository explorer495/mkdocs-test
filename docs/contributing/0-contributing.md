## Documentation

This [documentation](./1-contribute-docs.md) is written in mkDocs so a knowlege of HTML, CSS or Javascript not necessary.

## Development

We use C++, Python, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Android, and even make up our own languages. If you like dealing with code, there's something for all. See [here for how to contribute code](./9-contributing-code.md).

## Web Support

We do our support mostly via Discord, although some users prefer Facebook.

## Organization/Coordination

If you are good at herding cats in several countries and time zones then we could always do with some help.

## Code of Conduct

Be Nice

### Enforcement

Contributors who do not follow the be nice rule in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
