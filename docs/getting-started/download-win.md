# Download and install on Windows

- Download from here [Windows x64](https://github.com/DCC-EX/EX-Installer/releases/latest/download/EX-Installer-Win64.exe){ .md-button }
- Open the downloads folder where your browser has saved the EX-Installer-Win64.exe and execute it.

Note: depending on the configuration of your computer the ‘.exe’ may or may not appear. This is not of concern.

If your browser shows a warning like 

![warning](/_static/images/ex-installer/win_download1.png) 

you will need to select the "..." and select "Keep". On the next dialog 

![warning](/_static/images/ex-installer/win_download2.png) 

select  "Show more" and "Keep Anyway".

You should see 

![open dialog](/_static/images/ex-installer/win_download3.png)

and you can now select "Open file" to run the installer.
