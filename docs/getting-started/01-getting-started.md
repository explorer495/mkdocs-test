# Getting Started with DCC-EX

Unless you buy a Command Station Booster1 Express [CSB1](?CSB1) and use it solely as shipped with no accessories or options, you will need to download and install software to your Command Station or other products.

This is managed by EX-Installer which is responsible for obtaining the relevant software and libraries, merging your custom configurations and mind-bending automations, locating the USB connection to your device,  compiling and downloading the result and showing the serial log from your device if required.

## Warning Antivirus Software

You may need to turn off your antivirus software before you try to install, or you may be prompted to trust this executable.
